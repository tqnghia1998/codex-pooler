  This module defines the setup for tests requiring
  access to the application's data layer.

  You may define functions here to be used as helpers in
  your tests.

  Finally, if the test case interacts with the database,
  we enable the SQL sandbox, so changes done to the database
  are reverted at the end of every test. If you are using
  PostgreSQL, you can even run database tests asynchronously
  by setting `use CodexPooler.DataCase, async: true`, although
  this option is not recommended for other databases.

  Sets up the sandbox based on the test tags.

  The instance settings cache lives in `:persistent_term`, so it survives the
  sandbox rollback that returns the settings row to its baseline `lock_version`.
  Handing the published entry back keeps every test's cache consistent with the
  database it can actually see; otherwise a leaked version makes later tests
  ignore their own settings broadcasts as stale.

  It also puts the test under `CodexPooler.CommittedWriteGuard`, which fails
  the test when it leaves committed rows behind, and starts a sync test at the
  configured Logger level (`CodexPooler.TestLoggerLevel`).
