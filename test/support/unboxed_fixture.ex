defmodule CodexPooler.UnboxedFixture do
  @moduledoc """
  Helpers for fixtures that must commit rows outside the Ecto sandbox.

  `run_unboxed/2` runs the block in a linked `Task` so the caller's sandbox
  checkout is never replaced. That link is also why cleanup must be *registered*
  rather than *scoped*: an assertion failing inside the block raises in the task,
  the exit signal kills the untrapped test process immediately, and a `try/after`
  wrapped around the call never runs. The committed rows then survive into every
  later test of the same `mix test` invocation, where they surface as unique index
  violations in unrelated files instead of as the one real failure.

  `register_unboxed_cleanup!/2` puts the cleanup in ExUnit's own teardown, which
  runs however the test process died.

  Registers `fun` as unboxed teardown for the calling test.

  Must be called from the test process. The callback runs in ExUnit's on-exit

  assertion that failed inside an earlier `run_unboxed/2` block. It first
  waits for every websocket session cleanup still running, since one can
  still write rows of the fixture (findings#206 row 206-405).
